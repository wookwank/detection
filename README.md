# EasyVizAR supported ImVoxelNet 3D Object Detection Module

This module coordinates interaction with EasyVizAR Edge Server to automatically perform object detection on images uploaded to the edge server from AR headset devices such as Microsoft Hololens2, using monocular/multi-view 3D object detector ImVoxelNet. Alongside with EasyVizAR server implementation, HTTP requests via server and module are based on REST API principles.
