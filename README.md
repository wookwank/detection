# EasyVizAR supported ImVoxelNet 3D Object Detection Module

This module interfaces with the EasyVizAR Edge Server, facilitating automated object detection on images captured by AR headset devices like the Microsoft Hololens2. Leveraging the capabilities of the monocular/multi-view 3D object detector, ImVoxelNet, it ensures precise identification of objects within the AR environment. Aligned with REST API principles, our module integrates with the EasyVizAR server implementation, enabling standardized and streamlined communication protocols.

Implementation of this repository was based upon EasyVizAR supported YOLOv8 Object Detection add-on module.
